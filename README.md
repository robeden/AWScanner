# AWScanner

AWScanner is a tool for pulling information about resources in AWS accounts.
It's an experiment (i.e., toy) right now, so I'm not sure where it's going but
my current thought is it will focus on billing and minor security issues.

**This is experimental-quality code. Do not rely on it for production usage.
The API will change, it's probably unstable, and I'm sure there are bugs. It 
will almost certainly kick your dog and burn down your house.**
